## Description

Through extensive research, it was evident that when repeating the motion of removing a nail, the body is in an injury prone positon. Knowing this, the placement of the claw was relocated to the bottom of the hammer - facing the same direction as the hammer head. This idea improves both the ergonomics and the functionality of the hammer.

A [.stl file](files/hammer_final.stl) is attached above for further inspection of the CAD data.
